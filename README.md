# Command Counter

A simple server side tool to count the number of commands executed in every tick.  
This is a really simple tool... I don't want to do more, so build it yourself.  
Only supports Minecraft 1.21.5.  
But probably works on other versions too, only with a recompile and re-obfuscation.
